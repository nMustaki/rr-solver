# rr-solver
Python solver for Ricochet Robot

This project's dreamed endgame is to create a RicochetRobotAsAService,
and link it with a mobile app (if I can find some leverage to motivate my
fellow mobile dev to do it for me) to easily find out whether the fuzzy feeling
that "there's better" is real or not.

For the moment, it can only solve boards with only 3
turns... but there's no rush, only the will to have some fun and play
with Python.

To run it:

```shell
python main.py
```

You can give a seed to the random module:

```shell
python main.py 3345
```
